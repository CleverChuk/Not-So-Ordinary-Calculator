# Not-So-Ordinary-Calculator
A calculator that does more than just what your ordinary desktop calculator does.

# Motivation
This project was started from a conversation I had with one of my viewers on [liveEdu](https://liveedu.tv). This just a simple calculator that is very customizable and you can add your own custom operation if you know a little code and lambdas.
  
To run the program:
------------------
  
> You need python 3.x
   
On windows:
  
> if python is already in your PATH
> C:\user\\...\program_location> python Calculator.py
  
  On Linux:
> Just run Calculator.py as a command
